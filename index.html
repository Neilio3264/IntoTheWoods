          <h2>Synopsis</h2>
          <p>
            “Be careful what you wish for” seems to be the ongoing theme in
            Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s Brothers Grimm inspired musical,
            Into the Woods. The story follows The Baker and his wife who wish to
            have a child, Cinderella who wishes to go the King’s Festival, and
            Jack who wishes his cow would give some milk. When the Baker and his
            wife are visited by the neighborhood witch, who reveals to them that
            she placed a curse on their family, the two set off on a journey
            into the woods to reverse the curse. Also in the woods, we meet
            Little Red, who is trying to visit her grandmother, the Wolf who
            loves tasty little girls, the Witch’s daughter Rapunzel, and the
            Princes chasing after their loves. By the end of Act I, everyone has
            gotten their wish and will seemingly live happily ever after. But in
            Act II, when Jack’s beanstalk brings them a visit from an angry
            Giant, we see how the consequences of their actions haunt them in
            disastrous ways. The community must come together to save each other
            and their kingdom, but sacrifices must be made.

          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>
            Sondheim drew on parts of his troubled childhood when writing the
            show. In 1987, he told Time Magazine that the "father uncomfortable
            with babies [was] his father, and [the] mother who regrets having
            had children [was] his mother."
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4>Light and Darkness</h4>
          <p>
            A recurring theme is light and darkness. The title Into the Woods
            implies that the characters are venturing into the darkness, a world
            of evil. It is hoped that when they emerge through the other side
            and are transformed, they will be able to see the light. Darkness
            can also be interpreted as misunderstanding the truth, or looking
            inwards when undergoing a transformation. The items collected by the
            Baker and his Wife include a ‘milky white’ cow signifying purity and
            light.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Fairy tales</h4>
          <p>
            The theme of fairy tales forms the basis of the musical. Their
            appeal is their instantaneous connection with the audience through
            memories of childhood and innocence. Moreover, they also provide a
            form of escapism from everyday life. Fairy tales are widely used in
            films, most notably in Walt Disney productions as well as modern
            takes of classic stories targeted at both children and adults. The
            use of fairy tales provides the comfort and predictability in which
            Sondheim and Lapine can manipulate the plots to drive forward the
            story.
          </p>

          <h3>Function of Music</h3>
          <h4>Motifs</h4>
          <p>
            The use of motifs is a device used throughout the musical as a
            unifying thread. They signify important points in a fairy tale
            driven by the use of magic.
